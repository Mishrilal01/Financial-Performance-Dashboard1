Financial Performance Dashboard
This repository contains a Tableau Public dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive and interactive overview of key financial performance indicators (KPIs). The dashboard aims to empower users with quick insights into sales, profit, revenue trends, and efficiency metrics, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

Project Overview
This project involved the development and refinement of a Tableau dashboard to visualize critical financial data. The process included data preparation, extensive formatting, and the implementation of interactive features to enhance user experience and analytical capabilities.

Dashboard Purpose
The primary goal of this dashboard is to:

Monitor Key Financial Health: Provide at-a-glance insights into core financial metrics like Sales, Profit, and Total Revenue.

Track Performance Trends: Visualize how financial performance evolves over time.

Analyze Efficiency: Offer insights into operational efficiency through metrics like Profit Margin and COGS to Sales %.

Enable Interactive Exploration: Allow users to dynamically filter and segment data to uncover specific insights.

Key Features & Functionality
Custom Formatted KPIs:

Sales, Profit, Total Revenue: Displayed in millions (M) for improved readability (e.g., "119M" instead of "119,000,000").

Profit Margin, COGS to Sales %: Presented clearly as percentages.

Organized in a prominent, visually distinct section at the top of the dashboard with clear vertical dividers.

Interactive Filters:

Filters for dimensions such as 'Country', 'Products', and 'Segment' are implemented and applied across all relevant charts, allowing for dynamic data exploration.

Time-Series Analysis:

"Sales Over Time" and "Profit Over Time" charts visualize trends on a month-by-month basis, providing historical context.

Date data type conversion was performed to ensure accurate time-series plotting.

Heatmap for Product & Discount Analysis:

"Sales by Product & Discount Band" heatmap provides a visual representation of sales performance across different product lines and discount levels.

"None" values in the 'Discount Band' were filtered out for cleaner analysis.

Segmented Bar Charts:

"Sales & Profit by Country" and "Sales by Product" charts offer comparative views, segmented by relevant dimensions.

Consistent Visual Design:

A cohesive color palette has been applied throughout the dashboard for a professional and branded appearance.

Improved spacing, alignment, and removal of unnecessary chart borders contribute to a clean and uncluttered layout.

Reduced tooltip sizes for a less intrusive interactive experience.

Clear color legends are provided for easy interpretation of segmented data.
